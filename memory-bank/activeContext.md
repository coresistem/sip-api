# Active Context - Jan 2026 (Phase: THE ROOTS)

## Current Focus
We are currently in the **"ROOTS" phase of THE CORELINK GENESIS TREE**. The goal is to build an immutable architectural foundation for Csystem SIP, focusing on core identity and multi-role integration.

## Strategic Direction
- **System Identity**: Transitioning from product-specific silos to a unified "Csystem" root.
- **Protocol Adherence**: Implementing mandatory **"agent sync"** and **"endsession"** protocols to ensure session productivity and context preservation.

## What's been done
- [x] **Genesis Tree Ratification**: Updated `productContext.md` and created `GENESIS_TREE_ROADMAP.md`.
- [x] **Protocol Establishment**: Injected `agent sync` and `endsession` high-productivity protocols into `.clinerules`.
- [x] **Akar Stabilization**:
    - Silenced React Router v7 warnings.
    - Synced Super Admin credentials (`admin@sip.id`).
- [x] **Trunk Foundation**: Created missing module folders in `client/src/modules/` (`school`, `supplier`, `perpani`) to mirror the backend.
- [x] **Root Identity Migration**: 
    - Migrated biological data (`dateOfBirth`, `gender`, etc.) to the `User` model.
    - Resolved all backend type errors (Exit Code 0).

## What's Next (The Strategic Leap)
- [ ] **Unified Multi-Role Auth**: Implement logic for `User.roles` (JSON) to handle multiple active roles for a single identity.
- [ ] **Handshake Logic (The Sap)**: Implement the proposal/verification flow between Athletes and Clubs.
- [ ] **ID Refactor Audit**: Final verification of `coreId` ubiquity across all tables.

## Current Blockers
- None. (System is stable and protocols are active).
