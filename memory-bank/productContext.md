# Product Context: SIP (Sport Intelligence Platform)

## Why this product exists
SIP is designed to be a comprehensive ecosystem for managing sports talent, specifically focusing on talent identification, training tracking, and performance analysis. It bridges the gap between athletes, coaches, parents, and administrators (schools/government).

## Problems it solves
*   **Decentralized Data**: Athletes often have performance data spread across various platforms or physical logs. SIP centralizes this.
*   **Role Confusion**: Managing permissions and views for Coaches vs. Parents vs. Athletes can be complex.
*   **Talent Identification**: Providing a data-driven approach to identifying promising athletes through metrics like bleep tests and scoring records.

## How it works
*   **Frontend**: A modern PWA (Progressive Web App) built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Backend**: A robust API using Express, TypeScript, and Prisma ORM connecting to a PostgreSQL database.
*   **Key Modules**:
    *   Digital ID Cards for multiple roles.
    *   Event management and registration.
    *   Performance scoring (e.g., Archery).
    *   Administrative approval queues.

## User Goals
The project aims to provide a seamless, premium experience for all sports stakeholders in a region, making sports management professional and data-oriented.
